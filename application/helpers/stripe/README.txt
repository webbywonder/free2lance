Kudos for actually reading the README file! You have impressed me already.

This code was created by Larry Ullman (www.larryullman.com) and is explained in the series "Processing Payments with Stripe" (http://www.larryullman.com/series/processing-payments-with-stripe/). Note that you ought to read that series so that you UNDERSTAND the code before you try to use it. Also do not attempt to use this code if you don't understand the principles of Web development, including PHP and JavaScript specifically. Even though Stripe makes handling online payments easy, e-commerce is not for amateurs.

The code is meant to be used as a template for processing payments with Stripe (stripe.com). There are many things lacking from this code, such as what's being purchased, at what price, how the customer is defined (e.g., an email address), and storing completed orders in a database. If you know basic Web development, you should be able to add these with ease.

The code also requires that you download and install the Stripe PHP library (https://stripe.com/docs/libraries).

The CSS class names are based upon Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/).

That is all. Except for the...
